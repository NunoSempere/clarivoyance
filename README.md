Arb <> Open Philanthropy clarivoyance project
=============================================

This repository contains two documents commissioned by Open Philanthropy, on using forecasting to predict AI progress.

- [AI safety forecasting questions OpenPhil might find useful](./list/index.md) is a big list of around 700 AI forecasting questions. Its [folder](./list) also contains a few adjacent documents, like an operationalization of a resolution council, a discussion of how to operationalize FLOPs, and a small program to count the number of questions of each type.
- [Hurdles of using forecasting as a tool for making sense of AI progress](./hurdles/index.md) outlines some problem of using forecasting to predict AI progress.

The list of forecasting questions was produced by Gavin Leech, Misha Yagudin and David Mathers, who did the first 80%, and Nuño Sempere, which completed the second 80%. The hurdles document was primarily written by Nuño Sempere, with input and ideas from Misha Yagudin.
