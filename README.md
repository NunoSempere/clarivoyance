# Arb <> Open Philanthropy clairvoyance project

This repository contains two documents commissioned by Open Philanthropy, on using forecasting to predict AI progress.

- [AI safety forecasting questions OpenPhil might find useful](./list/index.md) is a big list of around 700 AI forecasting questions. Its [folder](./list) also contains a few adjacent documents, like an operationalization of a resolution council, a discussion of how to operationalize FLOPs, and a small program to count the number of questions of each type.
- [Hurdles of using forecasting as a tool for making sense of AI progress](./hurdles/index.md) outlines some problem of using forecasting to predict AI progress. For convenience, a pdf version is provided [here](https://github.com/NunoSempere/clarivoyance/blob/master/hurdles/pdf/hurdles.pdf). It is also available as a blogpost, with a comment section, [here](https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/11/07/hurdles-forecasting-ai/).

This list of forecasting questions was started by David Mathers, Gavin Leech and Misha Yagudin, of [Arb Research](https://arbresearch.com/) and completed by Nuño Sempere, of [Shapley Maximizers](https://nunosempere.com/consulting/). Open Philanthropy provided funding. The hurdles document was primarily written by Nuño Sempere, with input and ideas from Misha Yagudin.
